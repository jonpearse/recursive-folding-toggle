# Recursive Folding Toggle

A quick and dirty plugin for [Atom](https://atom.io/) that allows recursive toggling of code folding around the cursor on a keystroke.

Thrown together because it was useful to me, put on github because it might be useful to you: I will probably never touch it again =)

Share and enjoy!
